      <description>Problem There were some problems when we migrated our CI/CD from Git/Jenkins to VSTS. After many trial-and-errors, we solved them and note here for memo. - Incorrect replacement of connection strings. - Incorrect replacement of email address. - Incorrect replacement when using xml transform insert.
Summary - VSTS set parameters according to the base web.config. - VSTS set parameters by replacing them in web.config. - Following the previous two, there should be the config sections in base web.</description>

      <description>Problem There are several distributed webjobs in our system. Last weekend (late June 2018) there were many exceptions when our jobs tried to query data from specific one Redis server. But they could query other Redis servers normally.
These jobs all followed the suggestion from this Azure doc: Quickstart: Use Azure Redis Cache with a .NET application to connect to Redis server.
private static Lazy&amp;lt;ConnectionMultiplexer&amp;gt; lazyConnection = new Lazy&amp;lt;ConnectionMultiplexer&amp;gt;(() =&amp;gt; { string cacheConnection = ConfigurationManager.</description>

      <title>Test the effect of Redis connection setting: syncTimeout</title>

      <description>Story
As previous post mentioned, there were many redis timeout exceptions in our system. After we altered the minWorkerThread setting, we eliminated most of the HTTP 500 exceptions. But we still had many HTTP 401 exceptions and there was no problem if we lower the system loading from 10000 ppls to 1000 ppls concurrently.
Problem Lack async
Our system uses Redis as OAuth token storage, it looks kind of what Spring Framework does.</description>
