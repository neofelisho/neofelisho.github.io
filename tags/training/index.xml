      <description>Goal for 2019: Exercise more than 150 times In previous two years, because some reasons (excuses), I seldom exercised. In this year, my first goal is to rebuild healthy body.
January Gym 10 times, and road running 2 times. I forgot to take my sport watch to weight room 2 times (the red tick on the calendar).
February Gym 7 times, and road running 5 times.</description>
